        <h1>Sensations</h1>
        
        <strong>By Arthur Rimbaud</strong>

        <P><em>Through blue summer nights I will pass along paths, 
            <br>Pricked by wheat, trampling short grass:
            <br>Dreaming, I will feel coolness underfoot,
            <br>Will let breezes bathe my bare head.
            <br>Not a word, not a thought: 
            <br>Boundless love will surge through my soul,
            <br>And I will wander far away, a vagabond
            <br>In Nature - as happily as with a woman.
            </P>
