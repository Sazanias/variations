            <br>
            <br>Through blue summer nights I will pass along paths,
            <br>Pricked by wheat, trampling short grass:
            <br>Dreaming, I will <h2>feel</h2> coolness underfoot,
            <br>Will let breezes bathe my bare head.
            <br>
            <br>Not a word, not a <h2>thought:</h2>
            <br>Boundless love will surge through my <h2>soul,</h2>
            <br>And I will wander far away, a vagabond
            <br>In Nature - as <h2>happily</h2> as with a woman.</em></ol>
