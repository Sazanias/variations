        <strong>by Arthur Rimbaud</strong>
        <p>
           <br> <big>Through blue summer nights I will pass along paths,</big>
           <br>
           <br> <small>Pricked by wheat, trampling short grass:</small>
           <br>
           <br> <big>Dreaming, I will feel coolness underfoot,</big>
           <br>
           <br> <small>Will let breezes bathe my bare head.</small>
            </small>
           <br>
           <br> <big>Not a word, not a thought:</big>
           <br>
           <br> <small>Boundless love will surge through my soul,</small>
           <br>
           <br> <big>And I will wander far away, a vagabond</big>
           <br>
           <br> <small>In Nature - as happily as with a woman.</small>
            
       </p></ol>
