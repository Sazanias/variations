        <br> Sensations
        <br>by Arthur Rimbaud

        <P><br>
            <br>Through blue summer nights I will pass along paths, 
            <br>
            <br>Pricked by wheat, trampling short grass:
            <br>
            <br>Dreaming, I will feel coolness underfoot,
            <br>
            <br>Will let breezes bathe my bare head.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>Not a word, not a thought:
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>Boundless love will surge through my soul,
            <br>
            <br>And I will wander far away, a vagabond
            <br>
            <br>In Nature - as happily as with a woman.
            </P>
